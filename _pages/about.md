Welcome !ðŸ¤—
I am a second-year M.S. student from the School of Computer Science at Sun Yat-sen University. I am currently working on Multimedia Communication, Edge/Cloud Computing with Prof. [Di Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=guhA4VoAAAAJ). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, where I worked with Prof. [Qing Ling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=u70vRDYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on Distributed Machine Learning.

My current research focuses on optimizing the multimedia communication with machine learning. I have a passion for all kinds of sports, especially tennis, swimming and fitness.
